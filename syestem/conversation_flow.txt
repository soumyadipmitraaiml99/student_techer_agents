STUDENT–TEACHER AGENT CONVERSATION FLOW

1. User provides a topic for study.
2. Student agent reads:
   - student.txt (role)
   - shared_memory.json (conversation so far)
   - user topic
   and generates the first student question.

3. Save the student's question to shared_memory.json.

4. Teacher agent reads:
   - teacher.txt (role)
   - shared_memory.json
   and generates an explanation.

5. Save the teacher's answer to shared_memory.json.

6. Loop starts:
   - Student reads shared_memory.json
   - Student generates follow-up question
   - Save to memory
   - Teacher reads shared_memory.json
   - Teacher explains
   - Save to memory

7. Loop repeats for a fixed number of turns (e.g., 3–7 follow-ups).

8. User can reset memory anytime.

This system simulates a realistic study session between a student and a teacher.
